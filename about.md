## About Me
Hello. I am a Quality Assurance Automation Engineer living in Pittsburgh Pennsylvania, USA.  I have held a broad range of technology jobs, ranging from Software Engineer to UX Designer. This broad experience has caused me to think about QA in a holistic manner. It is with this experience and a strong background and interest in Software Engineering that I have found my professional home in QA Automation. I have been a practicing Automation Engineer for about 10 years. I do manual testing when needed, but the part of QA that I enjoy most is related to coding.  

## My Education
I hold a B.S. in Computer Science from John Carroll University.  While there I studied CS principles as well as Swarm programming, Neural Networks/Cognitive Science, and Network Security. I spent my summers doing research programming which led to several conference publications. This research-based education has created a love of tinkering and hacking together code to prove/disprove new ideas.  

## Where I Work
I am currently employed at [Maven Machines](https://mavenmachines.com/).  Most of my time is spent creating API automation tests using Cucumber, Python, and load testing with Locust.

## About the Site
I want to share my ideas on both the practical - engineering side of QA Automation as well as on the theoretical side - things like design patterns, technical writing, and software aesthetics.

## Topics I want to Cover

* QA Automation Practices and Principles

* Literate Programming

* Technical Writing for QA
