		<p>After studying and practicing as a QA Engineer for a little over 10 years, I have learned some hard lessons. Recently, I have been learning about Agile practices and how they relate to leading a team’s quality.</p>

<p>Getting ScrumMaster certified has been a first step into seriously studying the “process” of quality. Scrum and the Agile Manifesto before it really emphasizes what I would call soft skills.  For most of my career, I have always emphasized hard skills such as: coding craftsmanship, design patterns, test automation, TDD/BDD, etc.  During my work experiences it has never been these hard skills that caused failure.  It has always been the soft skills the lead to success of failure.</p>

<p>Quality is a team effort and QA Engineers must facilitate and lead for quality.  All the automation in the world cannot bring about success alone. I used to think of process as something that would get in the way of true software craftsmanship. Now I see it as a way to protect engineers from burnout and other scheduling abuse as well as a way to reinforce quality practices.</p>

<p>Learning more about process has led me to a second field of study - team science from Industrial and Organizational Psychology. Agile and Scrum talk a lot about cross-functional teams.  These types of teams have been heavily studied in the military and medical fields.  I believe much can be learned from these studies.</p>

<p>One of the leaders in team science is Eduardo Salas. He has a PhD in Industrial and Organizational Psychology, and has done research and training for the U.S. military and the medical field.  Through his studies, he has found that team training can account for about 20% of team performance variance.  While 20% might seem like a lot, what about the other 80%?  Some of the other 80% comes from organizational leadership and training.  In other words, team training without leadership support is just about useless.</p>

<p>In an interview with Dr. Salas, which can be found <a href="https://psnet.ahrq.gov/perspective/conversation-eduardo-salas-phd">here</a>, Salas talks in-depth about bringing what he learned from military team research to the medical community. One part of the interview stuck me as really relevant.</p>

<p>”””
The first thing is how physicians are trained and educated. I read recently about the cowboy mentality: “I know everything; therefore, I’m the one that has all the solutions.” Some of the resistance stems from the nature of the training and the education physicians are receiving.
“””</p>

<p>Software Engineering training can emphasize this “cowboy mentality” as well. Think of the image of the genius coder who will solve all the hard problems if only left alone with their genius and a keyboard.</p>

<p>In the end, like military and medical applications, Software Engineering must rely on cross-functional teams: Software Engineers, QA engineers, Devops, Security Engineers, etc.  I think QA Engineering can learn a lot from team science and Agile research/practice.  Quality is a team sport.  This leads to the conclusion that team psychology can be a useful field of knowledge to promote better software quality practices.  Check out the above article for an interesting conversation from one of leaders in team science.</p>
