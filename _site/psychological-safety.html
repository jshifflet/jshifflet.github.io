	<h2>Psychological Safety and Agile teams</h2>		
	<time datetime="2023-03-18T00:00:00-04:00" class="by-line">18 Mar 2023</time>
	<div class="content">

		<p>An article from Harvard Business Review on <a href="https://hbr.org/2023/02/what-is-psychological-safety">Psychological Safety</a> made me think about this concept in relation to Agile.</p>

<p>The article presents the definition of team psychological safety as:</p>

<p>”””
Team psychological safety is a shared belief held by members of a team that it’s OK to take risks, to express their ideas and concerns, to speak up with questions, and to admit mistakes — all without fear of negative consequences
“””</p>

<p>Let’s look at the four pillars of Agile in light of psychological safety.</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>1: Individuals and interactions over processes and tools.
2: Working software over comprehensive documentation.
3: Customer collaboration over contract negotiation.
4: Responding to change over following a plan.
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Individuals and interactions over processes and tools.  Putting individuals and team interactions first seems highly correlated with psychological safety.  Allowing engineers to feel open to bring up project risks for example.  I have been on teams where engineers don’t feel free to speak-up and raise concerns early on in projects for fear of being considered negative not giving their full support to a new project.  Research has shown that the earlier risks are raised, the more affectively their impact can be mitigated.</p>

<p>Only if risks are controlled, can the second pillar be realized: working software.  The entire reason for a software team to exist is to provide business value.  Although documentation is important, it is not the product.  This leads us into the third pillar.</p>

<p>The third pillar and psychological safety really intertwine.  Broadening the safety net to include the customer can be seen as itself risky and be uncomfortable move.  I have been on teams where the customer does not feel safe raising questions early on.  This leads to problems towards the end of a project when the software is delivered and does not meet: quality, usability, or even solve the business problem that was the entire reason for the project.  Customers must be feel comfortable raising concerns to the engineering team.  The engineering team must also feel free to raise their own concerns over risks and how features should be implemented, what features should be implemented, and sometime most importantly what features should be delivered later or not at all.  All involved parties need to feel safe to express their ideas and concerns without retribution.  This brings us to the fourth pillar.</p>

<p>The fourth pillar: responding to change.  First psychological safety lets the team admit that change is needed.  Once this is agreed upon, only wth such freedom can the team brainstorm and determine how to reorient, re-target, and respond to issues.  Diversity in roles, opinions, skills, and life experiences lead to a diversity of ideas.  Only if the team feels safe to express their different ideas can they ever be implemented.</p>

<p>Even though I am talking a lot about individual actions, the article emphasizes that the “team” in team psychological safety is important to note.  We are talking about a group phenomenon.  It is the milieu of the group that determines the level of psychological safety.</p>

<p>Both the research of <a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.2307/2666999">Amy Edmondson</a>, a Harvard Business School professor, and a research project called <a href="https://rework.withgoogle.com/print/guides/5721312655835136/">Project Aristotle</a> at Google, reaffirm the benefits of team psychological safety.  It is not always the teams with the highest performing individuals that maximize their performance.  Research has found the “who” of the team matters less than the “how” of the team’s operation.  For example, medical teams that admit more of their mistakes, actually perform better than teams that might appear to have less issues.  Again problems can only be fixed after they are identified.</p>

<p>If you can’t imagine it, it can’t be implemented. And a team is only the sum of individual imaginations that can be brought into the open.  Team members must feel free to identify issues, learn from them, and move forward together openly, freely, and with transparency in safety.</p>
