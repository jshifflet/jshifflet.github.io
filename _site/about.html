  <h2 id="about-me">About Me</h2>
<p>Hello. I am a Quality Assurance Automation Engineer living in Pittsburgh Pennsylvania, USA.  I have held a broad range of technology jobs, ranging from Software Engineer to UX Designer. This broad experience has caused me to think about QA in a holistic manner. It is with this experience and a strong background and interest in Software Engineering that I have found my professional home in QA Automation. I have been a practicing Automation Engineer for about 4 years. I do manual testing when needed, but the part of QA that I enjoy most is related to coding.</p>

<h2 id="my-education">My Education</h2>
<p>I hold a B.S. in Computer Science from John Carroll University.  While there I studied CS principles as well as Swarm programming, Neural Networks/Cognitive Science, and Network Security. I spent my summers doing research programming which led to several conference publications. This research-based education has created a love of tinkering and hacking together code to prove/disprove new ideas.</p>

<h2 id="where-i-work">Where I Work</h2>
<p>I am currently employed at a large academic medical center.  Most of my time is spent creating API automation tests using Cucumber, Ruby, and load testing with Locust.</p>

<h2 id="about-the-site">About the Site</h2>
<p>I want to share my ideas on both the practical - engineering side of QA Automation as well as on the theoretical side - things like design patterns, technical writing, and software aesthetics.</p>

<h2 id="topics-i-want-to-cover">Topics I want to Cover</h2>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>QA Automation Practices and Principles</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Literate Programming</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Technical Writing for QA</p>
  </li>
</ul>
