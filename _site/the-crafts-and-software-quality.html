		<p>    The Software Craftsmanship manifesto links the ideas of craftsmanship and high-quality software.  Building on Agile development methods, this manifesto’s first tenant is: building working and well-crafted software.</p>

<p>    I also believe there is a link between craftsmanship and software quality.  Craft guilds have created  “systems of quality” that span generations. By putting customers and quality first, these guilds were the first ensurers of what many technologists label: “user experience”.</p>

<p>   Organized by level of expertise, guild workers go from apprentice, to journeyman, to master. Having a built in education system, that helps nurture their members’ skills for life, members learn tool use, techniques, and theory.  From theoretical knowledge, to practical methods, the master passes on quality.</p>

<p>   Quality in guilds is pushed to the lowest level of work.  This “owning” of quality is also a main tenant of the Toyota production system.  In a Toyota factory, quality is the main responsibility of the lowest level line worker.  Each employee, no matter their level of seniority, can stop the line.  Similarly in guilds systems, the master is in charge, but his teaching should give each apprentice and journeyman the skills needed to “own quality” at each level of work.</p>

<p>    This is also known as servant-leadership in some circles.  No matter what level a worker is at, they should “lead”.  Quality comes only when each person in a production systems is given the tools and skills to build quality products that solve a user’s needs reliably.</p>

<p>    So how does this all relate to software?  In traditional software development, i.e. waterfall - quality is mainly owned by analysts that test after the code is written.  In Scrum this line is blurred a bit, but still exists.  In craftsmanship models, I believe this line dissolves.</p>

<p>   Only the person actually writing the application code can most effectively ensure quality.  From the first to last line of code written - quality should be the goal.  Every line of code will dictate if the product is of the highest quality.  I am speaking of the main tenants of software quality: maintainability, habitability, and extensibility.</p>

<p>    Can the software be refactored easily to fight entropy? Is the code habitable?  These two quality attributes lead to software that can grow with the user’s needs while the engineering teams productivity remains high.</p>

<p>    Only the developers of the application code can be the frontline of building a quality system.  So where does QA fit in?  They are there to support the developers.  By providing tools and automation frameworks specific to the application under development, QA engineers can allow developers to accelerate, while ensuring quality.  QA can still have final sign-off on user stories by providing exploratory testing and requirements checks, but automated regression suites and unit tests should be owned mainly by those closest to the code being tested.</p>

<p>    By providing the tools, training, and methods, guild masters maintain and promote quality.  QA engineers must similarly support the core code engineers.  This is not to say that each QA engineer is a master.  They can be at any level.  At whatever level they are at, they must be able to provide the methods and tooling in order to provide the foundation for a quality code base.</p>

<p>    As roles shift, and QA becomes a servant-leader to the core code developers, much can be learned from the crafts.  Guilds and craft systems have been used to maintain quality from generation to generation.  From the master masons who built the great gothic cathedrals of Europe, to tailors on Savile row, to cobblers who still make shoes by hand, the crafts may shed light on quality for that most modern of endeavors - software.</p>
